# Cineris participation guidelines

## Introduction

**TL;DR:** We are all responsible and accountable for creating a friendly, safe space for our game. 

These participation guidelines include expected behaviors and unacceptable behaviors. They encompass all the digital and physical spaces we occupy together and all the dimensions of diversity brought to our community.

We will strive to be an inclusive, family-friendly play group that is welcoming and inclusive of non-traditional gamers.

Following Mozilla's [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), these guidlines support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:

- Background.
- Family status.
- Gender.
- Gender identity or expression.
- Marital status.
- Sex.
- Sexual orientation.
- Native language.
- Age.
- Ability.
- Race and/or ethnicity.
- National origin.
- Socioeconomic status.
- Religion.
- Geographic location.
- Any other dimension of diversity.

We will use these guidelines whenever we come together in our playgroup and we understand that unacceptable behavior outside the playgroup can lead to consequences for the group, its players, and observers, as well.

## Safety

To make our game a friendly and safe space for players and observers, we agree to:

- Bring our best, whole selves to the game.
- Assume best intentions from others.
- Respect each other's bodies and spaces during sessions and outside them.
- Work intentionally to make this game a safe space for players and observers from diverse backgrounds.
- Include players and observers from diverse backgrounds in our game.
- Avoid all destructive, harassing, negative, threatening and otherwise harmful behavior including, but not limited to, violence or threat of violence, personal attacks, derogatory language, unwated sexual attension or physical contact, and disruptive behavior. 
- Report harassment and other harmful behaviors to the game master and any other relevant authorities.
- Accept the game master's decisions regarding violations of our agreements or find constructive ways to challenge them.
- Make decisions together as a group for the good of the group, its players, and its observers if the game master violates these participation guidelines.
- Support community members victimized by harassment and other harmful behaviors.

While there will be times in our game where we enter into dramatic conflict or represent violence, we will not do so in ways that harm people in our group.

## Safety tools

At any time and without judgment, a player may leave the game temporarily or permanently.

At any time and without judgment, a player may ask another player or game master to lower their intensity.

At any time and without judgment, a player may ask the group to stop play and address any issue.

At any time and without judgment, a player may report an incident of unacceptable behavior to the game master or to another trusted community leader if the report involves the game master.

## Inclusivity

To make our game feel as inclusive as possible, we also agree to:

- Avoid creating characters and role-playing in such a way that intentionall creates real-world, harmful conflict between characters that affectes players and obsevers or that harms players or observers.
- Resolve all inadvertantly harmful behavior to end it, prevent it, and make restorative amends because of it.
- Avoid interrupting or "solutioneering" others' individual contributions to the game.
- Follow the 50/50 rule: for each problem a player identifies, that player tries to suggest a solution to it.
- Follow the Nth rule: outside of situations governed by specific rules, each player will "take the spotlight" for 1/Nth of a scene or session where N equals the number of players in the session.
- Avoid using jargon and ask for clarification when we need it.
- Provide feedback in a timely way when invited to do so.

## General considerations for our behavior

Separate from our characters, we will approach one another with kindness and care and always err on the side of stopping play to check in on others who seem to be distressed.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful.
- Be direct, but courteous, unless someone is in danger.
- Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences.
- Lead by example.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Violence or threats of violence.
- Personal attacks.
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
- Disruptive behavior.
- Derogatory language.
- Influencing unacceptable behavior.

## Consequences

If you believe your are experiencing unacceptable behavior or that another player or observer is being submitted to unacceptable behavior, please report it to our game master or another identified "safety officer" or trsuted community leader in the play group or play space (like a trusted owner or manager of a local game store).

Violating these agreements may lead to a period of suspension from the playgroup or to indefinitie or total suspension from it. Violating these agreements also may to lead to the GM and/or others in the group alerting authorities to a bad actor's behavior.
