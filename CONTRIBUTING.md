## Using GitHub to File Issues

GitHub can be challenging for new users. If you experience difficulty with it, you are not alone. We want to help you overcome those challenges or find a way to contribute that works for you.

For this project, we can use a feature called the "Issue Tracker" in GitHub to communicate with one another. It's kind of like a shared message board combined with a to-do list. To address an issue to a specific person, you add their name to the issue the same way you would to a tweet, like this for example: putting @ before our game master's GitHub handle would address a message to our game master.

If the Issue Tracker is too difficult to use, contact our game master. They will work with you and help you find a way to contribute no matter what.

Here are some steps you can take to get started on GitHub if you'd like to try it.

1. First, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

2. Then visit [this repo](https://github.com/chadsansing/cineris-campaign).

3. Next, click on the "Issues" tab near the top of the page.

4. Finally, click on the green "New Issue" button to the left of the page. You can then title your issue and add content. Specificity helps.

Before you submit your issue, label it. You can choose one from the "Labels" dropdown menu to the right of your issue.

We have labels that will let you suggest:

- *Adventure ideas.* Help our game master come up with idea for our next adventure, campaign, or session.
- *Conversations.* Start issues with this label to talk about how the campaign is going with other players and to plot together outside official sessions. 
- *Feedback.* Let our game master know how the campign is going and suggest ways to improve it.
- *Questions.* As our game master any questions you have about the campaign or how its put together.
- *Bugs.* Let our game master know about practical and mechanical problems that need to be fixed.
- *Other.* Share your ideas about any topics related to the campaign or play group.
