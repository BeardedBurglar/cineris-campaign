# World-building on Cineris

## Welcome to Cineris!

Cineris is a homebrew campaign setting for [Cryptomancer](http://cryptorpg.com), a fantasty role-playing game about information security.

Cineris is a continent on Sphere, Cryptomancer's game world.

On Cineris, dwarves, elves, and humans are interconnected in a complicated economy of scarcity.

- Through superior numbers and a costly military campaign, humans colonized the dwarven homelands and now control crystal mining below ground and food production above ground.
- Dwarves have split into two factions after retreating from their homelands. One faction mines an arid wasteland for precious minerals and gems; the other has assimilated into eleven society. 
- Elves have retreated with their dwarven allies into a deep forest to farm Soma and range for substinance.

Although the wasteland dwarves hate their woodland cousins, both factions dream of retaking their homelands from the humans through temporary alliances, economics, intrigue, politics, and eventual violence. The Risk Eaters, Cryptomancer's actuarial-illimunati of the future, periodically nurture strife and chaos across Cineris to keep all of its inhabitants' ambitions in check.

Because of this web of interests and trade, agents from every race move relatively freely in one another's society, advancing obvious and hidden agendas alike.

In the midst of this uneasy era, your characters have all been drawn together by fate, happenstance, or something else, to witness and flee from an especially brazen and viscious Risk Eater attack in the wasteland's capital city of Portia.

## Geography

Cineris is an island continent no unlike Australia in its shape and size.

The entire western half of the island is covered by farmable plains. Below ground, ancestral dwarven settlements exist alongside rich shard crystal reserves. The dwarves made their settlements relatively close to the surface so they could noth farm and mine.

Mount Cineris, a dormant volcano sits roughly in the middle of the continent. A line of mountains splits the continnt in 2, running north-south. 

Another line of mountains splits the eastern half of the continent in 2, running east-west from Mount Cineris to the eastern coast.

To the north of this range is the eleven forest.

To the south are the aird wastelands. Several rivers badly polluted by heavy metals flow from Mount Cineris southeast and south to the sea in the arid wastelands.

Human colonizers have taken the entire western half of Cineris from the dwarves.

One faction of dwarves allied themselves with the elves to plot an eventual overthrow of the human settlements.

Another retreated to the arid wastelands and established coast cities. The darves onc sent mining parties and propsectors to bring heavy metals and othe rgems back west, but now they occupy these coastal cities and more permanent mines in the mountains near the riverheads so they can send materials downriver by barge.

## Trade

The humans monopolize shard crystal harvesting and most food production, though the elves and woodland warves can svavenge and range for sustenance.

They elves and woodland dwards control Soma production and woodcrafts. However, they destroy part of their forst every time a tree is sacrificed to grow a gigaphid for industrial or military use or to incubate a gigaphid Soma producer. They can extract value from the forest for a long time, but not forever.

The wasteland dwarves control prescious gem and metal mining. They cannot live without food from the humans, but the humans can't maintain their military strength without metals from th dwarves.

- Humans send crystals and food to the dwarves and elves.
- Elves send soma and woodcraft to the dwarves and humans.
- Dwarves send gems, metals, and related crafts to the elves and humans.

## Cultures

The humans are assimilation machines, mashing-up everything useful, fun, and innovative from the dwarves and elves. They are genial, but arrogant, believing themselves to be the winners of Cineris. They can't imagine losing their gains.

The elves are quiet and reserved, distrustful and resentful of the humans and hateful of their dependence on them. They have some deep, insticual unease about becoming drug dealers to the world, but they also nurture a hope that the woodland dwarves will help them expel the humans, hurting the market for Soma, and forcing them to return to a more balanced and harmonious life with nature.

The woodland dwarves are grim allies of the elves, working alongside them and adopting their cultures to ensure their survival and the chance of striking back at the humans. They will not forget that the elves offered to harbor them.

The wasteland dwarves hate just about everyone and believe themselves to be the true, dispossessed rulers of Cineris. They are deeply prejudiced against elves, humans, and especially the woodland dwarves, whom they consider traitors. Part of what the wasteland dwarves have learned is the deep cultural deception they've adopted to appear to be good faith actors and willing partners in the new world economy after the human conquest.

None of the races on Cineris acknowledge, discuss, or even enact their prejudices openly. Instead, their is an unspoken mutual agreement of sorts between cultures to participate in trade and diplomacy on the shard net and face to face (along with intrigue and preparations for violence). People trust one another to lie to keep the peace until it is ready to be more permanently broken.

## Locations

### Session 1

#### Portia

Portia is the capital city of the dwarven wasteland. It is above ground at the delta of the Black River, which flows south from Mount Cineris to the sea. The architecture is relatively boxy and brutal and mostly stone with some wood. Walls separate different districts to provide security and the illusion of going through passages between parts of Portia. 

The city is otherwise lively and is the hub of trade between the dwarves and humans and dwarves and elves. 

The humans sail along the southern shore of Cineris to get to Portia or travel overland aling the southern coast. 

The elves usually sail down the east coast of Cineris, past the mountains, and around the southern coast back to Portia rather than risk the overland route through the mountains and wastes.

Portia is the seat of the wasteland dwarves' government and its economic powerhouse. Several corporations, like Magmatic, have their home in Portia, and several executives, like Root Stoneshaper, live in its walled districts.

#### The Elven Forest

The deep elven forst is an arboreal paradise, but as you approach it you pass through ring after ring of exploded and used up trees that have incubated indsutrial gigaphds or Soma producers. The inner forest is shrinking as the Soma industry's ring shrinks in circumference. 

Most elves and almost all of thw woodland dwarves live in the outermost still-living ring of the forest that is being used for Soma production right now. In this ring, you can find a mix of temporary ground dwellings around trees (like Black Rock Cities) used for trade and mirgrant labor populations and elven dwelllings in the trees themselves. 

Deeper inside the forest, you find more traditional elven outposts, villages, and cities up in the branches and canopy of the oldest growth. There is history and safety there there, but not as much power as there is in the Soma ring. 

The architecture is balanced and organic and alive in the deep forest, but hasty, tacked on, made from scavenged materials, and parasitical in the Soma ring and ruins of the wasted outermost trees.
